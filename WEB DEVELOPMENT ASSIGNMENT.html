<h3 class="name">Name: BIRAGO ESTHER</h3> 
<h3 class="course">Course: BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING</h3>

<p>I am in the person of Esther Birago. A graduate from Anglican Senior High School, Kumasi. 
    In Senior High School, I studied General Sience and I am exploring my knowledge in the field of science now.
Currently I am a level 100 student in one of the prestigious universities here in Ghana, KNUST, reading Biomedical Engineering.
I am a very curious person so at my leisure time, I love engaging myself in research activities.
The state of the modern world really influenced my choice of courses in the university.
We live in a technology world now, so doing Medicine or Pharmacy wouldn't have been the best in my perspective.
Thinking of combining medicine and technology would be more beneficial as the future is concerned. 
My keen interest in not just reading but the combination of calculation and reading, pushed me to go in for Biomedical Engineering.
I am eagerly looking forward to exploring challenging problems and learning new concepts as my four years journey in this field is concerned.  </p>
